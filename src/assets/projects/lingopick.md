## 📖 Introduction

In the journey of language learning, context is king. Traditional vocabulary apps often present words in isolation, leading to rote memorization that fades quickly. **LingoPick** was born from a simple product philosophy: **capture the moment of curiosity**.

LingoPick is a browser extension that allows users to instantly translate and save words *within the context* of the article they are reading. By leveraging advanced AI, it provides context-aware definitions and seamlessly integrates into the user's browsing flow. It bridges the gap between passive reading and active vocabulary acquisition.

### Key Value Proposition
- **Contextual Learning:** Save words with their original sentence to retain usage context.
- **Seamless UX:** Non-intrusive popup interactions that don't break the reading flow.
- **AI-Powered:** Utilizes **Google Gemini** and **DeepSeek** to generate precise, high-quality definitions and collocations.

## ✨ Core Features

- **🖱️ Instant Word Picking:** Double-click or select any word on a webpage to get an immediate translation and phonetic transcription.
- **🤖 AI-Enhanced Definitions:**
  - **Brief Mode:** Quick definition and part of speech for immediate understanding.
  - **Full Mode:** Detailed explanations, example sentences, and collocations generated by Large Language Models (LLM).
- **📚 Vocabulary Collection:** A dedicated dashboard to manage and review collected words.
- **🗂️ Flashcard Review:** Review your collected words to reinforce memory (Spaced Repetition ready).
- **☁️ Cloud Sync:** Secure user authentication and data synchronization via **Supabase**.
- **🔐 Premium Licensing:** Integrated **Gumroad** license validation for premium features.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern, type-safe stack designed for performance and maintainability.

- **Extension Framework:** [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) (Next-gen Web Extension Framework)
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS v4, DaisyUI
- **Backend (BaaS):** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth)
- **AI Integration:**
  - Google Gemini API (via `@google/genai`)
  - DeepSeek API (via OpenAI SDK)
- **State & Storage:** `use-immer` for immutable state, `localforage` for robust local storage.
- **Build Tool:** Vite

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lingopick.git
   cd lingopick
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file or configure WXT secrets with your API keys:
   - `WXT_SUPABASE_URL` & `WXT_SUPABASE_KEY`
   - `WXT_GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - `WXT_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` (optional)
   - `WXT_GUMROAD_PRODUCT_ID`

4. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   # For Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave)
   npm run dev

   # For Firefox
   npm run dev:firefox
   ```

5. **Load Extension:**
   - **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://extensions`, enable "Developer mode", and load the unpacked extension from the `.output/chrome-mv3` folder.

## 💡 Highlights & Engineering Thoughts

### 1. Architecture: Service-Oriented Logic
To ensure the codebase remains clean and scalable, I separated business logic from UI components. The `libs/` directory contains specialized services:
- **`DatabaseService`**: Abstracts all Supabase interactions.
- **`TranslationService`**: Handles the switching logic between different AI providers (Gemini/DeepSeek) and prompt engineering.
- **`LicenceValidationService`**: Encapsulates the Gumroad verification logic.

### 2. AI Integration Strategy
Instead of relying on rigid dictionary APIs, LingoPick uses LLMs to generate definitions. This allows for:
- **Context Awareness:** The prompt includes the surrounding sentence, ensuring the definition matches the specific usage (e.g., "bank" as a river edge vs. financial institution).
- **Flexibility:** The `Prompts` class manages structured JSON outputs from the LLMs, making the UI rendering deterministic despite the AI's creative nature.

### 3. Modern React & Performance
- Adopted **React 19** to leverage the latest rendering improvements.
- Used **TailwindCSS v4** for a zero-runtime overhead styling solution.
- Implemented **LocalForage** to cache user settings and minimize unnecessary network requests.

### 4. Future Roadmap
- **Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** Implement an algorithm (like Sm-2) for the flashcard feature.
- **Multi-language Support:** Expand beyond English-to-Target translation.
- **Cross-Platform:** Explore migrating the core logic to React Native for a mobile companion app.
