# Personal Traits

## 🚀 Unstoppable Self-Learner
I am a lifelong learner who believes in building a rock-solid foundation.

* **The Spark:** My journey into code didn't start in a classroom at Conestoga College, but through pure passion in my spare time. Before arriving in Canada, *Professional JavaScript for Web Developers* by Nicholas C. Zakas opened the door for me, giving me a head start with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.
* **Reskilling at 30:** I deeply cherish the opportunity to return to school after 10 years in the workforce. Viewing these two years as a precious "reboot," I went far beyond the standard curriculum. I executed a rigorous self-study plan: mastering the **React** ecosystem while exploring **Svelte, Vue, and Angular** to broaden my horizons; and diving into **Python, PHP, and Node.js** to secure true full-stack capabilities across frontend, APIs, and databases.
* **Beyond "Vibe Coding":** While I embrace AI as a powerful accelerator, I refuse to rely on it as a crutch. My skills are built on reading documentation and writing code by hand, not just copy-pasting. I believe a solid understanding of the fundamentals is the only way to truly master modern tools.
* **Builder's Mindset:** I thrive on identifying real-life problems and building products to solve them. I treat every side project as a testing ground to refine both my product thinking and technical execution.

## 🎮 Hobbies & Inspirations
My life is built on code, history, and imagination.

* **Scale Modeler:** As a military history enthusiast, I used to spend hours crafting detailed scale models. Although I've paused the airbrush and glue since moving to Canada, this hobby instilled in me an **extreme patience for detail**.
* **Veteran Gamer:** Gaming is more than entertainment; it's a source of inspiration. I am a **10-year veteran** of *World of Tanks* and *World of Warships*, and I love the hardcore mechanics of *Monster Hunter* and the exploration in *Zelda*. I enjoy the camaraderie of multiplayer gaming and often look at game mechanics to inspire my own software interaction designs.
* **Sci-Fi & Reading:** Away from the screen, you'll find me reading or watching sci-fi. The futuristic concepts in science fiction often spark my thinking about the boundaries of technology.
