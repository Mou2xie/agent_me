# Personal Traits

## 🚀 Unstoppable Learner
I am a lifelong learner who continuously refines my knowledge and skills through self-study and hands-on practice. In fact, the majority of my expertise has been self-taught. My core philosophy is **"Learn what is needed, when it is needed."** Driven by this belief, I have not only mastered the professional skills of a Product Manager but have also successfully transitioned across design and programming. Today, I remain deeply engaged in learning AI-related technologies and integrating them into my professional workflows.

* **The Spark:** My journey into code didn't begin in a classroom at Conestoga College, but through pure passion in my spare time. Before arriving in Canada, I had already begun mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js through self-directed reading. Books like *Professional JavaScript for Web Developers* by Nicholas C. Zakas were my gateway into the world of programming.
* **Reskilling at 30:** I deeply cherish the opportunity to return to school after a decade in the workforce. I view these two years as a precious "system reboot," pushing myself far beyond the standard curriculum. I executed a rigorous self-study plan: mastering the **React** ecosystem while exploring **Svelte, Vue, and Angular** to broaden my horizons; and diving deep into **Python, PHP, and Node.js** to secure true full-stack capabilities across frontend, APIs, and databases.
* **Solid Foundations, No "Vibe Coding":** While I embrace AI as a powerful accelerator, I refuse to use it as a crutch. My skills are built on meticulously reading documentation and writing code by hand, rather than just copy-pasting. I firmly believe that a profound understanding of fundamental principles is the only way to truly master modern tools.
* **A Builder's Mindset:** I thrive on identifying real-life problems and building products to solve them. I treat every side project as a testing ground to refine both my product thinking and technical execution. I am never tied to a single technology stack; instead, I intentionally experiment with new tools in every project to expand my vision.

## 🎮 Hobbies & Inspirations
My life is built on a foundation of code, history, and imagination.

* **Scale Modeler:** As a military history enthusiast, I used to spend hours crafting detailed scale models. Although I have paused the airbrush and glue since moving to Canada, this hobby instilled in me an **extreme patience for detail**.
* **Veteran Gamer:** Gaming is more than just entertainment; it is a source of inspiration. I am a **10-year veteran** of *World of Tanks* and *World of Warships*, and I love the hardcore mechanics of *Monster Hunter* and the boundless exploration in *Zelda*. I enjoy the camaraderie of multiplayer gaming and often look to game mechanics to inspire my own software interaction designs.
* **Sci-Fi & Reading:** Away from the screen, you’ll find me immersed in sci-fi books or films. The futuristic concepts in science fiction often spark my thinking about the evolving boundaries of technology.
