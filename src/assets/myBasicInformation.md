### Personal Brief

With 10+ years of experience in Product Management, I bring a unique dual perspective to Full-stack Development. I bridge the gap between complex engineering and business strategy, specializing in the full project lifecycle—from conceptual architecture to scalable deployment.

I don’t just write code; I build solutions that balance exceptional User Experience with strategic business goals. My current focus is on integrating AI Agents (LangChain, n8n) into modern web frameworks (Next.js, Angular) to automate workflows and solve real-world problems.
